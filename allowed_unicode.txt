# Minecraft 1.8.9 is an ancient fucking version that only understands (practically) 5 unicode symbols; this is here to allow
# those 5 symbols it understands. All other non-ASCII characters that aren't present in this file will be stripped
# out of messages sent in Discord before being sent to be displayed in-game.
# This is necessary as (at least in vanilla 1.8.9) the font renderer will violently shit itself - and simply give up on rendering
# the entire rest of a chat message - if it encounters a symbol it doesn't recognize.
